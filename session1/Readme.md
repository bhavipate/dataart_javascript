# Timeline App

## Stage 1: Static Skeleton

This project is a timeline web application that will display events chronologically.  
Stage 1 focuses on building the **static skeleton** of the app using semantic HTML.

### Included:
- `index.html` with:
  - `<header>` containing logo and theme toggle
  - `<nav>` section for future filters
  - `<section id="timeline">` for event markers
  - `<div id="modal">` for future pop-ups
  - Semantic use of `<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, etc. (to be expanded in later stages)
- Basic project file structure
- Ready for Stage 2 (CSS styling)
